				DEVELOPMENT LOG

I'm renaming the entire project.  It turns out, after reading more on operating
systems development, I have realized that indeed, I did not consider what
happens when other people start to join. I cannot name it after myself, because
that would be condescending, self-absorbed, and a bunch of other words that I
don't want to associate myself with.  As such, I'm renaming it to Chicago,
until I can find a more suitable name.

I've deleted the repo in which this code was attached, and I'm starting anew.

I'm currently testing GPG keys so some commits might disappear. Any commits
that are modified do not touch the main code. I'm also experimenting with
sending emails with Git, and possibly integrating that into the VCS
component of this project.
