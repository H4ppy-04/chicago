				DEVELOPMENT LOG

I'm renaming the entire project.  It turns out, after reading more on operating
systems development, I have realized that indeed, I did not consider what
happens when other people start to join. I cannot name it after myself, because
that would be condescending, self-absorbed, and a bunch of other words that I
don't want to associate myself with.  As such, I'm renaming it to Chicago,
until I can find a more suitable name.

I've deleted the repo in which this code was attached, and I'm starting anew.
